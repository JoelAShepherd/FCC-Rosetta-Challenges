# FCC-Rosetta-Challenges
My solutions to the Rosetta challenge 'Sum to 100'
The challenge is to write code to find if a given number can be generated as a sum from the numbers 1-9 in order, seperated by + or -.
This code can identify if a number can be generated in this way, and prints all possible solutions.
